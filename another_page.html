        <h1>Firefox Features</h1>
        <b>Fast and lightweight:</b> The latest version of Firefox is faster than ever. Sync your browser: Create an account and sync your Firefox data across multiple platforms. If you’re logged in from both phone and computer, you can send tabs to open
        in the other device. Save passwords: Never remember a password or purchase a password manager again — Firefox can securely store all your passwords. More on this in the Security Feature section below.
        <br><b>Pocket:</b> This is a handy add-on that was created by Mozilla. You can easily save an article to read later. Pocket will add an estimated “time-to-read” to each article, and you can add tags, to help you remember why you saved the article
        when you have the time to read it. Adding Articles to Mozilla Firefox Pocket Click on the Shield to save articles for later

        the profile avatar, and choose the FIREFOX SEND or go to send.firefox.com and drag and drop the file. Then simply send out the link.How to use Firefox Send The step-by-step process for Firefox Send Screenshot: This is perhaps one of the most underrated
        features on Firefox. Right-click your mouse and the TAKE SCREENSHOT option will appear on the menu. The screenshot tool can recognize different elements on the page, making it easy to capture specific images or text, or you can select the area
        you want to screenshot. The final feature, which I love, is the option to take a screenshot of the entire page, not just the visible area. firefox screenshot tool Get great screenshots quickly with the Firefox Screenshot tool

        your computer and security. It also gives you a warning when visiting an unsecured HTTP website.
        <br><b>Monitor:</b> Firefox will scan all data breaches, dating back to 2007 to see if your Email address has been part of a hack or breach. Monitor will then update you as to what data was exposed in the breach and give tips for how to proceed,
        and what to do to protect yourself in the future.
        <br><b>Lockwise Password:</b> Password managers can be very costly, but with Firefox you can get the Lockwise password manager for free. Download the mobile app and secure it with TouchID or FaceID protection. The passwords are protected with
        a 256-bit encryption to make sure that no one but you can access them.
